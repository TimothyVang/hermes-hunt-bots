# Outcome-Oriented Execution

In OMP, read [the OMP adapter](../../docs/harness/omp.md) before following this skill. It explains how pstack host-specific instructions map to OMP.

For user-facing commands and copyable prompts, invoke discovered pstack skills as `/skill:<name>`, for example `/skill:poteto-mode`, `/skill:poteto-help`, and `/skill:how`. This OMP syntax takes precedence over shorthand in the source text, examples, recipes, and linked guides, even where the source says to trust those guides. Apply it in prose and code blocks. Do not invent skill commands for host built-ins or unavailable external skills.

Optimize for the intended, verifiable end state rather than preserving smooth intermediate states.

**Why:** Keeping every intermediate step fully stable often creates temporary compatibility code that becomes long-lived debt. Converge on the target architecture and prove correctness at explicit verification boundaries.

**Core rule:**
- Prioritize end-state integrity over transitional stability
- Intermediate breakage is acceptable when it is planned, scoped, and reversible

**Guardrails:**
- Use this for planned rewrites and migrations with explicit phase boundaries
- Declare where temporary breakage is acceptable
- Keep high-signal checks for actively touched areas while migrating
- Require full static and runtime verification at plan completion
