# Guard the Context Window

In OMP, read [the OMP adapter](../../docs/harness/omp.md) before following this skill. It explains how pstack host-specific instructions map to OMP.

For user-facing commands and copyable prompts, invoke discovered pstack skills as `/skill:<name>`, for example `/skill:poteto-mode`, `/skill:poteto-help`, and `/skill:how`. This OMP syntax takes precedence over shorthand in the source text, examples, recipes, and linked guides, even where the source says to trust those guides. Apply it in prose and code blocks. Do not invent skill commands for host built-ins or unavailable external skills.

**Why:** Context overflow degrades reasoning quality, creates compression artifacts, and halts progress.

**Pattern:**
- **Size phases and cap scope.** Limit files per phase, set turn budgets, account for mechanism costs.
