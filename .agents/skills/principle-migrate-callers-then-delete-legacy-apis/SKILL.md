# Migrate Callers Then Delete Legacy APIs

In OMP, read [the OMP adapter](../../docs/harness/omp.md) before following this skill. It explains how pstack host-specific instructions map to OMP.

For user-facing commands and copyable prompts, invoke discovered pstack skills as `/skill:<name>`, for example `/skill:poteto-mode`, `/skill:poteto-help`, and `/skill:how`. This OMP syntax takes precedence over shorthand in the source text, examples, recipes, and linked guides, even where the source says to trust those guides. Apply it in prose and code blocks. Do not invent skill commands for host built-ins or unavailable external skills.

- Update tests to assert the new contract, and delete tests that only protect pre-refactor implementation details

**When this applies:**
- No external users depend on backward compatibility
- The project can absorb coordinated breaking changes
- The new API is part of a simplification or refactor initiative
